# Character NFT Module

## Overview

The Character NFT Module is a Move-based project that facilitates the creation and management of character-based NFT collections. This module allows players to mint unique characters, with a limit of one character per account. The uniqueness and appeal of these characters can be enhanced through the purchase of three types of upgrades:

1. **Armour:** Changes the character's clothing and appearance.
2. **Trinket:** Adds an accessory, such as a pendant or hat, to the character.
3. **Weapon:** Equips the character with a distinct weapon.

As players acquire and apply these upgrades, they not only change their character's appearance but also increase its rarity and value. Each upgrade type offers a variety of items, resulting in a total of 7 different options for armour, trinkets, and weapons.
